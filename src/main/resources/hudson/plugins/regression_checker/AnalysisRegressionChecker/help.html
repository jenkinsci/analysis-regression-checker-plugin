    If the results of the code quality analysis worsens compared to that of the last successful build, mark
    the build as a failure. The net effect is that developers can no longer increase the code analysis warning count.

    <p>
    For example, say if you introduce 5 more warnings in build #10. This will mark your build a failure.
    If you fix 2 warnings in build #11, the build is still marked as a failure as you have 3 more warnings
    to fix. If you remove 3 warnings in build #12, then the build will be now marked as a success. So the
    system behaves as if there's an invisible threshold that progressively gets lower and lower.

    <p>
    If for whatever reason you need to reset the threshold, remove this post-build step from your job,
    produce a successful build, then re-enable it back in.
